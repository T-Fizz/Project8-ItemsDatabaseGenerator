# Project8-ItemsDatabaseGenerator

**This script requires python 3 to run, that is all.**

### without modification, the script will generate:
- file "pyGenItemsData.txt"
- 100 items in item database
- max price of items at 500
- prices generated at intervals of 0.05

You can change the generation settings by opening generate-item-database.py in your editor of choice (notepad works fine). Instructions are commented in the file.
